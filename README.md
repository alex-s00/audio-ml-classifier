# mini-project

The mini-project consists of two components:


1.   **Basic solution** : Using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset, build a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input a Potter or a StarWars audio segment and predicts its song label (either Potter or StarWars).
2.   **Advanced solution** : Formulate a machine learning problem that can be solved using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset and build a solution model.
